        <h2>Understanding AI Text Detection</h2>
        <p>AI text detection involves identifying whether a given text is human-written or generated by artificial intelligence models. With the rise of AI-generated content, it has become increasingly important to develop methods that can accurately differentiate between the two. This project aims to enhance detection capabilities by analyzing linguistic patterns, structure, and other textual features.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
        <p>The foundation of AI text detection lies in a well-curated dataset. Our project utilizes a dataset containing both human-generated and AI-generated text from various sources. Machine learning models, including transformers like BERT and T5, are trained to recognize differences in writing style, coherence, and syntactic structures. Feature selection and engineering play a key role in optimizing the modelâ€™s performance.</p>

        <h2>Model Development</h2>
        <p>We implement deep learning techniques, including Transformer-based architectures such as BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-based models, to build an effective AI text detection system. The models are trained and fine-tuned on labeled datasets to improve classification accuracy. Performance is measured using precision, recall, F1-score, and other key metrics to ensure reliable detection.</p>

        <h2>Implementation and Impact</h2>
        <p>The final AI text detection model is integrated into a web-based application that allows users to input text and receive real-time classification results. This tool is essential for content verification in education, journalism, and cybersecurity, helping organizations ensure authenticity and prevent misinformation.</p>
